# Stacks and Queues
Stack & Queue is  a type of of data structure consists of Nodes
## Stsck
* follow LIFO Concepts
* Push : Nodes or items that are put into the stack are pushed
* Pop : Nodes or items that are removed from the stack are popped.
* Top : This is the top of the stack.

## Queue 
* follow FIFO Concepts
* Enqueue - Nodes or items that are added to the queue.
* Dequeue - Nodes or items that are removed from the queue
* Front This is the front/first Node of the queue.

## Challenge
* write node class with 
* write Stack class these methode (**push()** ,**pop()**, **peek()**, **isEmpty()**)
* write Queue class these methode (**enqueue()** ,**dequeue()**, **peek()**, **isEmpty()**)
## Approach & Efficiency
* **stack :** Pushing, popping, and peeking takes Constant Time — O(1)
* **Enqueuing:** to the back and dequeuing from the front is also very quick and takes constant time — O(1)
## API
1. **Stack :**
* **push()** Pushing (adding) to the top of the stack
* **pop()** poping(removing) from the top of the stack
* **peek()** see the item a the top of the stack
* **isEmpty()** returns true when stack is empty otherwise returns false.

2. **Queue:** 
* **enqueue():** add an item to the queue at rear
* **dequeue():** remove an item from the queue at front
* **peek():** see the first item in the queue without removing it
* **isEmpty():**returns true when queue is empty otherwise returns false.
