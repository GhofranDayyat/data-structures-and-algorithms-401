# Singly Linked List
 * Singly refers to the number of references the node has. A Singly linked list means that there is only one reference, and the reference points to the Next node in a linked list.
## Challenge
* create singly linked list by class to insert any value to the LL , check if value exist and convert LL to string 
## Approach & Efficiency
O(n)
O(1)
## API
* insert(value): to insert any value to LL by create new node
* includes(): returns a boolean result depending on whether that value exists as a Nodeâ€™s value somewhere within the list.
* toString which takes in no arguments and returns a string representing all the values in the Linked List,
