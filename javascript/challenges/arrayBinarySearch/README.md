# Challenge Summary
Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language we need to  return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.
## Challenge Description
we need to solve this challenge using binary search ;mean divided the array in a half then compar the start value and the last value in thr fist half when low become greater than high 
update the low value one step up each time if test greater than number and And vice versa with high value

## Approach & Efficiency

* Determine low index =0, high index =length of the input array
* Divide the  array it in half to use the index of middle array
* start compare the value in the middle part of array with enter number
* make a end point for your loop when low become greater than high 
update the low value one step up each time if test greater than number and And vice versa with high value
